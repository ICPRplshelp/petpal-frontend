# CSC309 Petpal

This is the frontend of the course project I've made for CSC309.
I'm open sourcing this as I've written some components
that are very reusable, if you ever want to use that
in a project that are very DRY compliant. For example:

- Paginator and PaginatedList
- FormFields

**The deployment is broken - the backend is not active.** I
don't plan on open-sourcing the backend.

Also, the instructor of the offering of this course (CSC309) has given the entire class permission to open source their project.

Note that this is a group project with 3 other team members, but for privacy reasons unless they request me, I'll keep them anonmyous.
